# Name Guesser: UK Edition

[This name guesser](https://flowingdata.com/2020/01/21/name-guess/) by [Nathan Yau](https://flowingdata.com/about-nathan) is really lovely.

I’ve modified it to use UK data from the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).

The ONS [makes annual data available](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/adhocs/10429babynames1996to2018englandandwales) for England and Wales, from 1996 to 2018.

NB. There’s also [historic ranking data by decade](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/babynamesenglandandwalestop100babynameshistoricaldata
) going back to 1904, but I didn’t use that.
