# Name Guesser: UK Edition

[This name guesser](https://flowingdata.com/2020/01/21/name-guess/) by [Nathan Yau](https://flowingdata.com/about-nathan) is really lovely.

I decided to modify it to use UK data from the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).

The ONS makes annual data available, but only for England and Wales, and only from 1996 to 2018.

Here’s the data:

There’s also historic ranking data by decade going back to 1904, but I didn’t use that:
